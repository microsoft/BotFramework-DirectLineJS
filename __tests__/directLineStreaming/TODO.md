# To-dos

Due to resources constraints, while we are working on PR #404 to improve the code quality, there are scenarios we missed.

- [ ] TEST: Connect with an invalid token
   - WHEN: Create chat adapter with an invalid token
      - THEN: Should observe `Connecting` -> `FailedToConnect`
   - WHEN: Call `reconnect()` with a valid token
      - THEN: Should observe `Online`
   - WHEN: Call `postActivity()`
      - THEN: Should send message
      - THEN: Should receive bot reply
- [ ] TEST: Connect with a non-existing conversation ID
   - WHEN: Create chat adapter with a non-existing conversation ID
      - THEN: Should observe `Connecting` -> `FailedToConnect`
   - WHEN: Call `reconnect()` with a valid conversation ID
      - THEN: Should observe `Online`
   - WHEN: Call `postActivity()`
      - THEN: Should send message
      - THEN: Should receive bot reply
- [ ] TEST: Renew token should work
- [ ] TEST: Call `end()` after `FailedToConnect`
   - WHEN: Call `connect()` without a server running
      - THEN: Should connect 3 times
      - THEN: Should observe `FailedToConnect`
   - WHEN: Call `end()`
      - THEN: `activity$` should observe completion
      - THEN: `connectionStatus$` Should observe `Ended` -> completion
   - WHEN: Call `reconnect()`
      - THEN: Should throw
- [ ] TEST: `FailedToConnect` should be observed immediately after 3 unstable connections
   - WHEN: Call connect()
      - THEN: Should observe `Online`
   - WHEN: Kill the socket immediately
      - THEN: Should observe `Connecting`
         - The observation should be immediate (< 3 seconds)
      - THEN: Should reconnect after 3-15 seconds
   - WHEN: Allow it to retry-connect successfully
      - THEN: Should observe `Online`
   - WHEN: Kill the socket immediately again
      - THEN: Should observe `Connecting`
         - The observation should be immediate (< 3 seconds)
      - THEN: Should reconnect after 3-15 seconds
   - WHEN: Kill the socket immediately one more time
      - THEN: Should observe `FailedToConnect`
         - The observation should be immediate (< 3 seconds)
   - WHEN: Call reconnect()
      - THEN: Should reconnect immediately
      - THEN: Should observe `Online`
- [ ] Make sure all state transitions are tested (see `API.md`)
   - In the state diagram in `API.md`, make sure all edges (arrows) has their own tests
   - Certain scenarios are time-sensitive, the time to the call must be verified
      - For example, when transitioning from `Online` to `Connecting` for the first time, the Web Socket connection must be established within first 3 seconds
         - If the connection is being established after 3 seconds, it means a backoff is done
         - Backoff is undesirable for the first retry attempt
